# Bilayer shells

Implements a nonlinear Kirchhoff bilayer shell, consisting of two (or potentially more) adhering thin shells. Local stresses can be generated by differential swelling of the shell layers. This is modeled in the code by effectively mapping the residual stresses to an effective change of the targeted first and second fundamental form ("metric" and "curvature"). Minimization of elastic energy is performed using C1 continuous subdivision surface finite elements as implemented in Libmesh.

This code was used for M. Pezzulla et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 048002 (2018) and M. Pezzula et al., Proc. R. Soc. A 473:20170087 (2017).

Make sure you first set up all environment variables (LIBMESH_SETUP_ENV) according to your system setup.

Required libraries:
- Libmesh (see my other repo for a customized version)
- PETSc
- VTK (to output results)
